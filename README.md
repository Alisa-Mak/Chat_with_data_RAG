# Chatting with data using RAG
# AI-Driven Data Interaction with ChatGPT and LangChain

This "AI-Driven Data Interaction with ChatGPT and LangChain" example! It guides you through the process of building a sophisticated chatbot capable of interacting with Vonage manuscript data using ChatGPT and LangChain. Throughout this example, you will learn to elevate your expertise in AI-driven data analysis and customer interaction.

## notebook Description

In this notebook, we are developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution to interact with our Vonage manuscript database. You will discover how to integrate conversational AI into data interaction using cutting-edge technologies like ChatGPT and LangChain.

This comprehensive example covers key topics such as:

- Prompt engineering
- Vector databases
- Data retrieval
- Question answering

By the end of this example, you will have a deep understanding of how to develop complex Language Model (LLM) applications, handle vector databases, and create AI solutions that intelligently interact with and extract insights from diverse data sources.
